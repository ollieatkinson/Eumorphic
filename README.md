[Sugar for type preserving heterogeneous containers for Swift]

--- 

`Any`,  `[Any]` and `[String: Any]` are type-erased values which allow for the storage of heterogeneous data structures.
Typically these erased structures are difficult to work with and are seen quite a lot with code that utilises `JSONSerialization`. 
Eumorphic aims to ease the burden of use by providing a light sugar over these erased types.
